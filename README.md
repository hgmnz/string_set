What is this?
-------------

This is intended as a gentle introduction to TDD/BDD for people who have not
experienced it before. We all know what a set does, so let's focus on the
running tests and letting those tests drive the implementation.

* Fork this project and clone it locally
* Open up spec/string_set_spec.rb
